Welcome to Yoink's documentation!
=================================
Yoink is a tool for extracting data from rasterized images.

At SciPy 2013, Matt Terry gave a humourous `lighting talk`__ demonstrating
yoink pulling data from an image despite an especially obnoxious colormap.

with the quirky macosx backend.
